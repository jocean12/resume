            Hi and welcome to my website. I’m a Web Designer and Developer with a passion to learn new technologies and languages. I’m lucky because my work is also one of my passions. I love solving new problems and finding new ways to solve old problems. I enjoy managing teams and seeing projects go from concept to completion.  Along with developing and programming I enjoy surfing, photography and spending time with my amazing wife and children.
